            A simple light bodied ale, with a high wheat content to give crispness and a cloudy pale yellow color.  
            Subtle noble hop bitterness is present.  The star is the yeast, one of the oldest strains in the world,

            throughout the city, dumping full barrels in the streets to show their dissatisfaction. The city officials formed a city-owned brewery 
            that would begin brewing only bottom-fermented beers. Lagers were born. This classic style is built on a simple grain bill, 
            brewed with traditional lager ingredients delivering a clean, light-bodied style. Noble hops add slight bitterness while allowing the 
            distinctive spicy and piney aroma characteristics to show through. With a crisp, dry finish, this style is best enjoyed in warm temperatures. `,

            A simple American grain bill is treated with old-world techniques creating a distinct color and body which is light enough for summer and 
            strong enough for winter.  All noble hops provide a classic mild and spicy bitterness.`,

            Slightly toasted grains are coupled with several additions of Candi sugar. The final act of this style is portrayed through

            five pounds of raisins, which are pureed and caramelized before adding them to the boil. Minimal hop contributions 
            prevent the sweetness of the fruit and candi sugar from becoming cloying without contributing bitterness.
